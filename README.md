# Multi-Camera_Self-Calibration

This project is trying to develop an algorithm that combines two methods the first is:
Quick Guide to Multi-Camera Self-Calibration by Tomáš Svoboda, Computer Vision Lab, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich BiWi-TR-263, Version 0.2, August 20, 2003.
And by adding the second method:

This will give us a fuller solution that will help generalize the way we use multi-camera calibration.
